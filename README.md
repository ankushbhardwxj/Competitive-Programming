Sport Programming is not my forte but I do it for fun and learning optimizations so that maybe someday I can apply it to real world apps. I love problem solving, but letâ€™s face it, solving `reverseLevelOrder` traversal of a binary search tree is a lot less fun than solving a real-world problem for your latest app.

This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:

- Solutions may be require external dependencies to work
- Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
- Machine understandable solutions humans not so much

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is. I do not offer support for these solutions. Feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.
